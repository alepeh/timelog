# Runtime dependencies
# Rationale:
# - Use compatible lower bounds with a conservative upper cap to avoid unexpected
#   breaking changes from new major/minor releases.
# - Django: target the current stable minor line; cap to <5.2 to avoid future minor changes.
# - psycopg[binary]: convenient prebuilt wheels for local/dev. If your repo policy
#   discourages binary wheels (e.g., in some Linux distros or FIPS/musl builds),
#   switch to plain `psycopg` (source build) instead â€” see commented alternative below.
# Update cadence:
# - Review and update quarterly or alongside Django minor releases.
# - Validate in CI before raising caps.

Django>=5.1,<5.2
psycopg[binary]>=3.1,<4
# Alternative (if binary wheels are discouraged):
# psycopg>=3.1,<4

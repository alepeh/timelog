# Development dependencies
# Rationale:
# - Mirror runtime requirements via `-r requirements.txt`.
# - Pin compatible ranges to keep tools recent while minimizing breakage.
# - Include typing, linting, formatting, testing, coverage, security, and optional
#   dependency management tools.
# Update cadence:
# - Review monthly; bump when new minor versions are released and CI is green.
# - Align formatter (black) version with pre-commit/hooks or editor configs.
